Group 9

In this project, we collaborated to create a table based off of families looking for new homes. The three sub-metrics that were looked into were supermarkets, parks, and crime rates/safety.

For crime rates, we based the safety of neighborhoods depending on how large the crime rates were in each neighborhood. We divided safety into three sub-metrics that we figured were the most important when living in a neighborhood. Those three submetrics were aggravated assault, simple assault, and robberies. These are largely one of the main offenses that people who are house hunting look for. 

From there, we concluded that neighborhoods like Mt. Oliver Boro were the safest and neighborhoods like South Side is the least safest.


The next sub-metric we considered was activities to do in the area specifically those that were offered at local parks. We first looked into which parks had the most amount of activities and how accessible they were. We then found which neighborhood had the most amount of parks since an increase in the number of parks and activities to do would also increase the likeability of a neighborhood. 

The last sub-metric we factored into our result was supermarkets. The best neighborhood had to have the most number of supermarkets. This was an important factor because with a low number of supermarkets in a neighborhood, the less variety of food a family is offered. We then from the csv totaled the amount of supermarkets in each neighborhood to see which was the best.
