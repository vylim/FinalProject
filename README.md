# Introductions

In this project, we collaborated to create a table based off of families looking for new homes. The three submetrics that were looked into were, supermarkets, parks, and crime rates/safety.

For crime rates, we based the safety of neighborhoods depending on how large the crime rates were in each neighborhood. We divided safety into three submetrics that we figured were the most important 
when living in a neighborhood. Those three submetrics were, aggravated assault, simple assault, and robberies. These are largely one of the main offenses that people who are house hunting look for. From there, 
we came to the conclusions that neighborhoods like Mt. Oliver Boro were the safest and neighborhoods like South Side is the least safest.
